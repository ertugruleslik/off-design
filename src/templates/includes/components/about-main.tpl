                A very warm welcome to OfDesign.net Interior Design, your one-stop portal for all things design related!
                <br><br>
                OfDesign is the ultimate home of interior design and our progressive mission is to continue growing our portal into the be-all and end-all of interior design, through the provision of design samples, ideas, photos and other useful information to streamline your interior design process or to give you some much-needed inspiration. We have it all — if you don’t find it here, you won’t find it anywhere.
                <br><br>
                Great interior design starts with a visual cue or a conceived idea, which is why we make extensive use of high-quality, clear and accurate photographs and diagrams to effectively communicate the advocated design standards. Our ideas and standards cover interiors such as living room designs, dining room designs, bedroom designs, kitchen designs, bathroom designs and even children’s room designs, incorporating all style preferences, from retro spaces right up to modern arrangements.
                <br><br>
                Interior design encompasses more than just the physical layout and choice of surface colors used in your interiors, with equally important elements to consider such as the complementary furniture designs, lamps and lighting design and even immediate surroundings such as garden design. The creative and functional use of space is another major consideration when designing interiors, with the right balance of space-usage fundamental to any successful interior design project. Even minimalist looks take a bit of skill to get right and, with the right kind of advice and useful tips we provide, you will have no problems conceptualizing and mastering even the most challenging of interiors.
                <br><br>
                OfDesign’s extensive collection of interior design intelligence is not only for the budding interior designer, although all instructions and guides are easy enough to be understood by amateur or casual interior designers. Professionals for whom interior design is a career can also draw huge benefits out of browsing and exploring our platform, as this can be a major source of inspiration for some of their projects. The inspiration permeates all areas of the home, from the major focal areas such as living rooms and kitchens all the way to more functionally-inclined interiors, such as home offices or even man-caves.
                <br><br>
                Whether you need to brush-up on the interior design knowledge you already have or indeed if you don’t know where to even start, this is definitely the place for you to find it all. For the development of even a single concept such as the construction of a wooden bar, selecting a comfortable sofa design or organizing your bathroom, OfDesign Interior Design explores (in detail) numerous options and alternatives.
                <br><br>
                While we’re aware of the mainstream design trends and extensively feature a lot of contemporary designs, we’re equally aware that the majority of interior design projects require that personal touch which adds your own signature to your spaces. This is where our no-stones-unturned approach to bringing you interior design ideas comes into play, helping you get familiar with those design styles and flavors that will eventually make up your signature taste.
                <br><br>
                Our featured interior design ideas incorporate influences from all over the world, so there are plenty of options available, even for those with a bit more of a contemporary or exotic vision for their interior spaces
